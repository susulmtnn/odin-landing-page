Odin-landing-page

In this project I practiced html and css (flexbox).

You can find the separate files for html and the style sheet.

This was part of the Odin project self study course and you can find the specific requirements for the exercise here:

I did not include any pictures and kept the original texts for now.

I might modify the project later.
